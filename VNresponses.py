If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees.', 'In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit.', 'When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero.', 'Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed.', 'According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings. Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero.', 'In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit.', 'If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving.', 'And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings.', 'By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings.', 'Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings.', 'First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find.', 'Second.

The wormhole tunnel suffers from super gravity, and collapses as soon as it opens.", 'So we need something to negate the effect of gravity.', "So-called 'exotic matter'.

To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort.', "For example, let's say there's a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles.", "First, we send the wormhole in LA all the way to the end of the universe at near the speed of light. And once it's there, we yank it back to LA.", 'According to the special theory of relativity, time slows down for objects moving at the speed of light.
